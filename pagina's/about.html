            <h2>The story behind astorya</h2>
            <p><span class="hoofdletter">W</span>e are three students from Thomas More University of Applied Sciences in Mechelen, united by a shared vision to make a lasting impact. Astorya was born from our desire to create something timeless — a digital space where stories, memories, and love can continue to shine long after we’re gone. We wanted to create a way for people to leave something meaningful behind — a way to share their love, wisdom, and memories with those who matter most.</p><br>
    
            <p>Our platform allows everyone to preserve their legacy in a unique way, making sure that important moments, lessons, and connections are never lost. Astorya isn’t just about memories; it’s about connection, comfort, and creating a bridge between generations.</p><br>
                
            <p>Guided by our passion for technology and storytelling, we built Astorya as a way to honor the past, celebrate the present, and inspire the future.</p><br>
                
            <p>We believe that every life is like a star — unique, bright, and worthy of remembrance. And through Astorya, those stories will continue to light up the sky.</p>
